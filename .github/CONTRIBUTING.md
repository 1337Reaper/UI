# Contributing to UI Lovelace Minimalist

First of all thank you to be part of this awesome Minimalist 'theme'!
The following is a set of guidelines to contribution to the Minimalist 'theme'. You are always free to open an Issue or to make a PR to fix a bug, add a card or for something else.

## Pull Requests

For Pull Requeste we use for now two branches:

- [`main`](https://github.com/UI-Lovelace-Minimalist/UI)
- [`release`](https://github.com/UI-Lovelace-Minimalist/UI/tree/release)

Both branches handle different types of pull requests. <br>
The `main` branch is for pull requests related to "Custom-cards" and bugfixes of documentation files. <br>
The `release` branch is for all HACS-release related requests.
These are mostly adaptations and or bugfixes to official cards and their documentation or changes in workflows related to the HACS integration.

All pull requests need to be checked and approved by at least one admin.

## Guidelines

All the YAML and documentation files need to follow some guidelines to provide consistency. These can be found [here](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/development/custom_cards/). You could also find there instructions to develop your own "Custom"-cards.
