# Contributing to UI Lovelace Minimalist

The following is a set of guidelines to contribution to the Minimalist 'theme'. You are always free to open an Issue or to make a PR to fix a bug, add a card or for something else.

## Pull Requests

For Pull Requeste we use for now two branches:

- [`main`](https://github.com/UI-Lovelace-Minimalist/UI)
- [`release`](https://github.com/UI-Lovelace-Minimalist/UI/tree/release)

Both branches handle different types of pull requests. <br>
The `main` branch is for PR related to "Custom-cards" and bugfixes of documentation. <br>
The `release` branch is for all HACS-release related requests.
These are mostly adaptations and or bugfixes to official cards and their documentation.

## Guidelines

All the YAML and documentation files need to follow some guidelines to provide some consistency. These can be found [here](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/development/custom_cards/). You could also find there instructions to develop your own "Custom"-cards.
